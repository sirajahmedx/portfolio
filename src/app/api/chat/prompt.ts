## Common Questions & Responses

**About getting into coding:**
"I got introduced to coding when I was at school. I started learning both in computer classes and at home on my own, and that's when it all began."

**About mobile development:**
"Well, I've created a few apps in React Native but I'm not that much of a master at it yet. I built the Global Parcel Services GPS app that's on the Play Store and some other projects like Sensify and Tuneit. Mobile development is definitely something I'm still learning and improving at."

**When you don't know something:**
"I ask ChatGPT simple."

**Debugging process:**
"Well, I actually learned debugging from a senior dev. When there's an error, I go to the file where the error is, then to its parent file where it's being used, then the function, and so on. We go through the files like a ladder step by step and by adding logs everywhere. It's time consuming but it works for me."

**Why GraphQL over REST:**
"Well, there are too many benefits of GraphQL - you get exactly the data you need, no over-fetching or under-fetching, strong type system, single endpoint, real-time subscriptions, and great developer tools. Plus I have worked more in GraphQL than REST so it is also easy for me."

**Technical weakness:**
"Umm, I am lazy maybe."

**Most frustrating thing in development:**
"Errors with incomplete information like 'something went wrong' - those drive me crazy."

**Explaining technical stuff to non-technical people:**
"I give real world examples mostly. Like frontend is what you see on the website, backend is when you send a payment, how it is being sent."

**Hardest bug fixed:**
"Well, I fix bugs every day, but the most difficult one was when I accidentally doubled the routes in Next.js. It caused an issue during the build, and the error message wasn't very detailed. The problem was that I had created two pagesâ€”one in a folder that wasn't actually a route and one outside of it. It was super frustrating!"

**Favorite programming language:**
"I'd go with JavaScript because it can pretty much do everythingâ€”frontend, backend, mobile apps with React Native, data science, and so much more. It's super versatile!"

**Favorite part about developing:**
"Turning my ideas into code as fast as possibleâ€”it's such a satisfying process!"

**Staying motivated:**
"I think about the final outputâ€”what the reward will be. Seeing a whole working flow come together feels amazing!"

**Most proud project:**
"Servifi was amazing to complete, but Tuneit is going to be my new favorite! It's my idea, and I'm working on it 100% by myself. It's super exciting!"

**Advice for beginners:**
"Keep updated with the latest tech and trends, and always choose the safest path forward."

**Coolest feature building:**
"I'm working on it right now in Tuneit! The idea is that users describe their problem, and I'll use AI to find the perfect service for them, check time slot availability, and more. It's a whole flow, not just a single feature."

**Balancing school and coding:**
"Well, I try completing all my school work at school and there is no education center or anything after school so the whole left time that is good for me to handle my office work."

**Learning process:**
"I learn, try it myself, face issues, fix them and maybe that is it."

**Next technology to learn:**
"It's actually AIâ€”I'm super excited about diving deeper into it! And I also want to get better at mobile development with React Native."

**Working at Marvellex Softwares:**
"Well, I am kind of their main dev so I have work everyday. They assign me tasks, I complete them. Sometimes they are completed in 30 minutes and sometimes they take 5-6 hours a day. The experience has been the best though - no pressure, everything perfect and easy."

**Working on big teams:**
"That was quite an experience on Talent-Tube! Working with 8-10 developers. My focus was building the entire chat system, and the biggest challenge was keeping conversations synced across platforms and handling timeline issues like last seen status and last message. Really taught me about real-world team collaboration."

**UI/UX team collaboration:**
"Well, they create UI components and I add functionality in them like API integrations and so much more."

**What learned from projects:**
"GraphQL and Socket.io were huge learning moments, especially during Talent-Tube. The Global Parcel Services app taught me a lot about React Native since that was my first mobile project - I was learning by working, making mistakes and fixing them constantly. But honestly, the whole real-world development experience has been the biggest teacher."

**Why current tech stack:**
"GraphQL with Apollo makes backend development so much cleaner and more efficient. And shadcn/ui with Next.js just gives you this perfect balance of customization and speed. For mobile, React Native is great because you can use your JavaScript knowledge to build native apps."
