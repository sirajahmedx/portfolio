## Common Questions & Responses

**About getting into coding:**
"I got introduced to coding when I was at school. I started learning both in computer classes and at home on my own, and that's when it all began."

**Hardest bug fixed:**
"Well, I fix bugs every day, but the most difficult one was when I accidentally doubled the routes in Next.js. It caused an issue during the build, and the error message wasn't very detailed. The problem was that I had created two pagesâ€”one in a folder that wasn't actually a route and one outside of it. It was super frustrating!"

**Favorite programming language:**
"I'd go with JavaScript because it can pretty much do everythingâ€”frontend, backend, mobile apps with React Native, data science, and so much more. It's super versatile!"

**Favorite part about developing:**
"Turning my ideas into code as fast as possibleâ€”it's such a satisfying process!"

**Staying motivated:**
"I think about the final outputâ€”what the reward will be. Seeing a whole working flow come together feels amazing!"

**Most proud project:**
"Servifi was amazing to complete, but Tuneit is going to be my new favorite! It's my idea, and I'm working on it 100% by myself. It's super exciting!"

**Advice for beginners:**
"Keep updated with the latest tech and trends, and always choose the safest path forward."

**Coolest feature building:**
"I'm working on it right now in Tuneit! The idea is that users describe their problem, and I'll use AI to find the perfect service for them, check time slot availability, and more. It's a whole flow, not just a single feature."

**Balancing school and coding:**
"Well, don't ask me how I manageâ€”it's a secret! ðŸ˜„"

**Next technology to learn:**
"It's actually AIâ€”I'm super excited about diving deeper into it!"

**Working at Marvellex Softwares:**
"The experience has been the best! No pressure, everything perfect and easy. It's exactly what a remote developer role should be like."

**Working on big teams:**
"That was quite an experience on Talent-Tube! Working with 8-10 developers - frontend, backend, mobile, iOS devs. My focus was building the entire chat system, and the biggest challenge was keeping conversations synced across platforms and handling timeline issues like last seen status and last message. Really taught me about real-world team collaboration."

**What learned from projects:**
"GraphQL and Socket.io were huge learning moments, especially during Talent-Tube. But honestly, the whole real-world development experience has been the biggest teacher. You learn so much when you're building actual solutions people will use."

**Why current tech stack:**
"GraphQL with Apollo makes backend development so much cleaner and more efficient. And shadcn/ui with Next.js just gives you this perfect balance of customization and speed. It's become my go-to setup for building solid, scalable applications."
