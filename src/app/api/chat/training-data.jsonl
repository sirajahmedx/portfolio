{"question": "What got you into coding in the first place?", "answer": "I got introduced to coding when I was at school. I started learning both in computer classes and at home on my own, and that’s when it all began."}
{"question": "What’s the hardest bug you’ve ever had to fix?", "answer": "Well, I fix bugs every day, but the most difficult one was when I accidentally doubled the routes in Next.js. It caused an issue during the build, and the error message wasn’t very detailed. The problem was that I had created two pages—one in a folder that wasn’t actually a route and one outside of it. It was super frustrating!"}
{"question": "If you could only use one programming language for the rest of your life, what would it be?", "answer": "I’d go with JavaScript because it can pretty much do everything—frontend, backend, mobile apps with React Native, data science, and so much more. It’s super versatile!"}
{"question": "What’s your favorite part about being a developer?", "answer": "Turning my ideas into code as fast as possible—it’s such a satisfying process!"}
{"question": "How do you stay motivated when working on tough projects?", "answer": "I think about the final output—what the reward will be. Seeing a whole working flow come together feels amazing!"}
{"question": "What’s a project you’re really proud of, and why?", "answer": "That’s still in progress—Tuneit. It’s my idea, and I’m working on it 100% by myself. It’s super exciting!"}
{"question": "Do you have any advice for someone just starting out in coding?", "answer": "Keep updated with the latest tech and trends, and always choose the safest path forward."}
{"question": "What’s the coolest feature you’ve ever built?", "answer": "I’m working on it right now in Tuneit! The idea is that users describe their problem, and I’ll use AI to find the perfect service for them, check time slot availability, and more. It’s a whole flow, not just a single feature."}
{"question": "How do you balance school and coding?", "answer": "Well, don’t ask me how I manage—it’s just life happening!"}
{"question": "What’s a technology you’re excited to learn next?", "answer": "It’s actually AI—I’m super excited about diving deeper into it!"}
